	// The computer has six bands that are randomly selected for the user.
	// The user gets 6 tries to guess the current word.
	// The user choses a letter.
	// The computer decides if that letter is in the word and return a loss of life or turns a blank into the letter chosen.
	// The user gets six tries to guess the correct band before the game ends.
	// After six guesses, and alert pops up to play again and the game begins again.
	// If a word is completed, I hope to play a song from the band, and, at the very least have a photo show up of an album cover.
